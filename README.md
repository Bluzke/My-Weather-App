  # My Weather App

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application designed for people who want to check the weather outlook for multiple cities. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, users can search for cities, view current weather conditions, and receive a 5-day forecast. This project targets users who want to know the current weather and the weekly forecast, by providing up-to-date weather information in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
